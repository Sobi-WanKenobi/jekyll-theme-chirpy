### [Why I Left Developer Relations (dev rel)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p0LYU_mA_0)

Are you a company that feels like it needs to have a Developer Relations team to be one of the *cool* companies, or check off a box on the *no, really, we're a technology company* list? Are you looking to go into Developer Relations as a career? You need to give this a watch.

If you're not quite sure what DevRel *is*, check out this post I linked mid-August: [I think, therefore I YAML](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-think-therefore-yaml-dave-stanke/)

### [What Your Boredom at Work Is Actually Telling You](https://lifehacker.com/what-your-boredom-at-work-is-actually-telling-you-1850788112)

Good, quick hit here from LifeHacker. From signaling burnout to increasing creativity and innovation, some level of boredom is a good thing and reinforces why we shouldn't be scheduling teams at 100% capacity ([even the Harvard Business Review is on to this](https://hbr.org/2023/06/to-build-a-top-performing-team-ask-for-85-effort)).

> Boredom forces us to be with our thoughts, something many people are loathe to do. In fact, one study found that participants would rather self-administer electric shocks than be alone with their thoughts. “Most people seem to prefer to be doing something rather than nothing,” the study concludes, “even if that something is negative.”

### [Disaster relief often leaves disabled people behind. Disabled first responders are trying to change that](https://prismreports.org/2023/08/31/disabled-first-responders-disaster-relief/)

When a disaster strikes, I don't think there are many people who aren't at least somewhat concerned for the people affected. Getting people food, shelter and basic necessities is likely one of the first ways to think to help. But how often does someone without a disability, or who doesn't know someone living with a disability, think about the special needs of this population?

Like anything, it's easy to forget that not everyone has the same life or life experience as you do. When the power goes out for me, it's an inconvenience. A long outage is frustrating. But for someone who relies on medical equipment, an extended outage can be deadly (now think about that population in Puerto Rico, where some were without power for *months* following Hurricane Maria). Now think about not being able to hear (or hear much), and what the impact might be when first responders are evacuating an are or looking for survivors. Disability can be complicated in a normal world; thinking about what that may be like in a disaster will definitely make you sit back.

This is another one of those articles that everyone should read to understand how other people may be affected by large scale events. It may even help some realize that there may be additional actions that they need to take to help protect their loved ones from a worst-case scenario.

> With climate-related crises growing worse, a comprehensive disability-led approach to disaster relief is more important than ever. Flooding is expected to get worse as sea levels rise, rain rates and wind intensities increase, and the number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes also likely goes up. 

### [Right to repair’s unlikely new adversary: Scientologists](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/right-to-repairs-new-unlikely-adversary-scientologists/)

*Right to Repair* is a fascinating topic -- from John Deere to car manufacturers to Apple, the efforts to maintain hold over proprietary repair facilities that often charge a lot of money, is huge. The question of whether it should be allowed when you own the product is a problem in and of itself. 

But where do the Scientologists come in?

While there does not seem to be any hard proof, it seems that this may be the result of the Church of Spiritual Technology's *E-meters*. As the only known product that might be impacted by *Right to Repair*, the damage a successful suit here could do if successful -- requiring that only someone with particular training could make repairs -- would be vague enough so as to render any protections moot. In essence, companies could require *their* training, at a high cost, to meet the criteria, or withhold it altogether. It's going to be interesting to see where this goes.

### [In every reported case where police mistakenly arrested someone using facial recognition, that person has been Black](https://www.businessinsider.com/in-every-reported-false-arrests-based-on-facial-recognition-that-person-has-been-black-2023-8)

This may be a dead horse, it bears raising awareness every time it comes up. As technologists, we have a duty to not do harm to people. The fact that these are known problems and products are released into the wild is unethical at best.  The damage bad algorithms can, and do, do to people's lives should make any form of software used to make judgments about people highly regulated with severe penalties when harm is done. Good to see more and more legal action being taken on behalf of the injured.

> In 2020, Detroit's police chief said their facial recognition technology, when used alone, fails 96% of the time, Insider previously reported.

### [Ingram, Reeves, and Wilson vs. Wayne County, MI](https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/23a0203p-06.pdf)

Not many know that there is little most people can do to stop law enforcement from seizing your assets -- from your car, to your home, or even cash on hand -- with very little cause in a lot of places (see [Detroit Civil Forfeiture](https://ij.org/case/detroit-civil-forfeiture/) for information on this case). Even if you are not guilty or simply awaiting a court date, you may not get your stuff back for a long time, if at all, and the impact on low-income people is even worse. This forfeiture model has become a huge revenue generator for law enforcement all over the country. This ruling makes the current process in Wayne County unconstitutional and requires that the county provide a hearing within two weeks (normal process could take up to *10 months*).

This is an important case simply because of the fast and loose way law enforcement uses the forfeitures. Not only are there fees for towing a car for example, but also storage fees and more, that must be paid before the car is returned. Failure to pay can result in the car and all the property inside being auctioned off and the money going to the local government. Absolutely worth a read -- this could easily happen to you by simply being in the wrong place at the right time.

> Unlike criminal forfeiture, civil forfeiture does not require the property owner to have committed a crime. Anyone’s vehicle can be seized based on one police officer’s suspicion that it was, in some way, connected to a crime. Even being near an alleged crime is enough. And anyone’s crime will do. The vehicle owner does not have to be under suspicion, even when he or she could have done nothing to prevent the crime from happening.

### [How to Remove Secrets From a Git Repository](https://dev.to/arthvhanesa/how-to-remove-secrets-from-a-git-repository-36e4)

It happens. You're chugging along and forget to exclude a file from your commit and -- *whoops* -- you've managed to commit sensitive info to your repo. Nice, straightforward strategy here for getting them out though, as one of the commenters notes, it's probably also a good choice to change that information if at all possible.

### [Results of Major Technical Investigations for Storm-0558 Key Acquisition](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/09/results-of-major-technical-investigations-for-storm-0558-key-acquisition/)

Kudos to Microsoft for being transparent and releasing the findings of their investigation of the compromise of a signing key in July. This is a great write-up detailing what happened, how the environments are configured, and how the key was exposed. Also included are the remediations Microsoft have done to prevent a similar action in the future. Well worth the read to understand where you may find holes in your security.

> The crash dumps, which redact sensitive information, should not include the signing key. In this case, a race condition allowed the key to be present in the crash dump (this issue has been corrected).

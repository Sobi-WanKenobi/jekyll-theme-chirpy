# READ ME
I am Ken Sobieski -- *Sobi-Wan Kenobi*, or simply *Sobi-Wan* to some -- and this is my personal README, a version of the [Manager README](https://useworkshop.com/resources/manager-readme-template-example/), using a format from [Mike Petrovich](https://petro.blog/my-personal-readme-13287f18223d) which I found seemed to work well for non-managers . The intent is to help anyone who works with me understand me better.

## Beliefs
If there is one thing that overrides all others, it's that relationships matter more than anything else in this world. You can go to work every day, and yet not really *know* anyone, or you can make the effort to build relationships that create trust. A high-trust team will always perform better over the long term.

I believe a lot of things to be true:
- estimates of work when used to help a team improve processes are helpful; estimates used as a cudgel to create *commitments* are not
- *Agile* is meant for small teams to improve their processes and produce *value*; agile at scale does not work well, especially when teams are forced to align on sprints or framework (e.g., Scrum or Kan-ban) rather than do what works best for them
- it is important to follow *the boyscout rule* and leave code better than you found it; cleanup work that is left for later -- especially when put into a backlog -- will rarely get done
- Object-oriented languages should follow object-oriented design patterns and standards, while functional languages should be used for functional programming; unlike Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, mixing the two do not *taste great together*
- Slow is smooth, smooth is fast; working too fast without forethought will take at lest twice as long for rework.
- naming things correctly is one of the most important things we do; to ignore the names and underlying concepts will result in bad software that is hard to maintain
- collaboration between design, engineering, leadership, and *the business* is imperative to successful software; walled off groups with different mental models lead to bad software (see naming above)
- you can have a team that engineers software or you can have a team that builds to spec; one of these is bad for business
- trying to measure *productivity* for an engineer does a disservice to the person; imagine measuring a finance person by the number of spreadsheets produced
- [Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)](https://adr.github.io/) are a great gift for people in the future, including yourself; trying to understand why something is the way it is without context of the decision long after the *why* has been forgotten leads to poor decisions
- [Blameless Incident Reports (Postmortems)](https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/) are immensely valuable for preventing future, similar problems *if the action items are completed*; fixing blame rather than the root of the problem leads to mistrust and an unwillingness to risk reporting issues
- All beliefs may flip 180 degrees given proof they are incorrect; incorrect only means that better information wasn't available *at the time the belief was formed*

## Strengths
There are a few places I tend to find better success than with others. 

I:
- invest in those around me and help build teams
- care about my customer, my teammates, and getting things done right
- seek out feedback to try and improve
- enjoy sharing things I learn, and enjoy learning from others
- ask a lot of questions to get to the core of a problem and look at different ways of thinking about it
- try to create a space where it is safe to ask questions
- am told I have a talent for helping people tease apart code and clean it up, and a surprising amount of patience for it
- am very much an [ambivert](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/ambivert) and like to get people interacting (don't make me pull out the *dad jokes*); I will probably try to engage people while on a conference call waiting for the meeting to start

## Weaknesses
Like everyone, I have things I struggle with, that can frustrate not only me, but others as well. 

I:
- can find it difficult to start working on something without a decent understanding of it
- can get tripped up accepting something as *good enough*
- struggle mightily with [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) which can hold me back
- have a tone when I'm asking probing questions that my wife tells me conveys the sentiment *what are you, a dumbass?* (I assure you this is not the case and I try to be hyper-aware of it)
- like to help people solve problems, sometimes to my own detriment
- sometimes over-commit my time
- can have a hard time given an estimate for things thanks to both old-trauma and the multitude of potential wrenches
- have a tendency to try to solve problems when sometimes all that is needed is someone to listen (if this is the case, be blunt about it)
- I can have strong opinions that come off as immovable, especially when I feel like I have enough information to *know* I'm right
- am very much an [ambivert](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/ambivert) and sometimes I can get overwhelmed by too much activity and rah-rahing.

## How I Work
I like to collaborate. I ask a lot of questions. I mean *a lot*. I want to know what I am building and why, with language that reflects the common usage in the *customer's* world. This can be frustrating for some because taking time to think through a problem or understand the underlying concept can delay tangible software. I firmly believe that building the wrong thing quickly is orders of magnitude worse than building the right thing at a pace that is slower than desired.

I like to pair-program. Not only does it help to build better software by spreading knowledge immediately, it finds errors better than after-the-fact code reviews, and it helps to build relationships. I can understand why some people don't enjoy it; it can be tiring to have that much communication going on for extended periods and sometimes it seems easier to *just do it* (not to mention, if *productivity* is measured in commits to the repository, then you have to worry about who gets the credit).

At times I also like to work alone, especially when digging deep on a problem or design. This gives me an opportunity to get ideas into a *slushy* state before taking them wider for critique.

I tend to carve out time for relationship building, including regular one-on-ones with team mates. I do my best not to move these because they are important, though at times unavoidable conflicts do come up. As a rule of thumb, I shoot for:
- teammates: once every two weeks
- direct lead: once a week
- lead one level up: once a month
- others: as is convenient for both of us

I have managed to train myself to *not* check email or chat constantly, and follow a simple set of guidelines:
- if you need an answer in a day or so, or are simply conveying time-*insensitive* information, email is fine (I try to check at the beginning and end of the day)
- if you need an answer withing a couple of hours, chat is great
- if you need an answer right away, call (text may work, too)

## How to Give Me Feedback
Please, oh please, try not to ask if I want to have a *chit-chat* or hit me with a *have you got a minute* without context. Like a lot of people, these statements tend to ramp up my anxiety, especially when coming from someone in a leadership role. Context is everything.

**Especially for my leaders:** I had a great leader who, at review time, would say something along the lines of *this is pretty much a recap; if there is something in here you weren't expecting, then I haven't been communicating well.* If there is something that needs correcting, please let me know as soon as it occurs. 

### The feedback is positive
I am one of those people who tend to *not* enjoy large public displays very much, though I can tolerate them; I'm sure it has something to do with my childhood. If you want to give me positive feedback, a quick email or message is great and appreciated, or personally in a one-on-one works too.

### The feedback is critical
Give it to me privately. In person is probably best because the tone is conveyed better. If you email or send it in chat, my anxiety will read it with the harshest possible tone.

 I may not like or agree with the feedback in the moment, but I *will* sit with it and chew on it. While I try to be self-aware, like anyone, I have areas that are less apparent and I can only get better by hearing others perceptions.
